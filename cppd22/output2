(Line:29147)  12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
hel
(Line:29200)  7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.

hel
(Line:29255)  16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.

(Line:29257)  18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not. 
hel
(Line:29258)  19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. 
hel
(Line:29260)  21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 
hel

hel
(Line:29385)  24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree? 
hel
(Line:29400)  2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. 
hel
(Line:29407)  9	[Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 
hel
(Line:29419)  21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. 
hel
(Line:29423)  3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

(Line:29424)  4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil. 
hel
(Line:29451)  16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

(Line:29456)  21	[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. 
hel
(Line:29461)  2	Let every one of us please [his] neighbour for [his] good to edification. 
hel
(Line:29511)  18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 
hel
(Line:29512)  19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all [men]. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. 
hel
(Line:29624)  6	Your glorying [is] not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
hel
(Line:29654)  1.	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman. 
hel
(Line:29661)  8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 
hel
(Line:29679)  26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be. 
hel
(Line:29925)  33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 
hel
(Line:30069)  10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad. 
hel
(Line:30089)  8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;

(Line:30150)  8	And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to every good work:

(Line:30244)  11.	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. 
hel
(Line:30345)  18	But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.

(Line:30396)  10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
hel
(Line:30412)  5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
hel
(Line:30416)  9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 
hel
(Line:30441)  10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 
hel
(Line:30504)  28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.

(Line:30550)  7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
hel
(Line:30551)  8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free. 
hel
(Line:30576)  6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ: 
hel
(Line:30585)  15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 
hel
(Line:30614)  13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure. 
hel
(Line:30620)  19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
